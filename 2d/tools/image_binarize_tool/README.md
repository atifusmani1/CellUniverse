# Cell Binarization tool

Python GUI for manual cell image binarization. Users can manually pick a
threshold for a given video and binarize it. Below are the features implemented for this app.

- Start by selecting File > open images from the menu bar.

- Select the folder which contains all the frames of a video. 

- Enter the following variables:
  - File name pattern: If your image file name is 0.png, 1.png , 2.png .... 400.png. You would enter %d.png where %d is a substitute for natural numbers 0 to 400.
  - Start frame number: Enter an integer of the first frame you want to binarize. 
  - End frame number: Enter an integer for the last frame you want to binarize 
  - Frame interval: This determines the number of frames in between two adjacent frames. If you pick too small of Frame interval the application won't be able to display all the frames correctly. Use this formula to calculate the smallest frame interval you can pick. frame interval > (end frame number) / 132. For example, if your end frame number is 400 then you must pick a frame interval greater than 3 (400/132).

- Set a threshold for each page by sliding the select page slider. The images displayed will change as you slide the slider. Use the recommended threshold to get an estimate of the threshold you will pick. Pick a threshold so that the cells are white in color and the background is pitch black. 

  - To use this feature start by sliding the threshold for page 1. You will see (on the right side) that the threshold for all the following pages changes as well.

  - Now as you go to page 2. The threshold for page 1 is saved. Changing the
threshold now will change it for the current page and all the following pages.

  - Keep going through all the pages to select the threshold for each. The threshold
for each page can be viewed on the right side of the window.

- Once you have gone through all the pages and are satisfied with the previewed images. It's time to save all the binarized images. Click File > save segmented images. Select a directory you want to save binarized images to. Depending on the number of images, it'll take few seconds to save binarized images.

- Ability to see recommended threshold. The app uses Otsu's method to come up with a
recommended threshold. The number is generated by averaging all the images’ otsu’s
threshold.
- Ability to see the histogram. The “Display Histogram” button in red shows the
histogram for the top-left frame (also in red) shown in the GUI window. In the figure
above when a user presses the Display Histogram button Frame 390’s histogram will be
shown. The histogram will change for each page as the frame on the top left changes. The
red vertical line is the threshold chosen by the user for that page.
